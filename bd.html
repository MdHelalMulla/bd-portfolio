        <h1>Know about Bangladesh</h1>
        <p class="peragraph">The riverine country of Bangladesh (“Land of the Bengals”) is one of the most densely
            populated countries in
            the world, and its people are predominantly Muslim. As the eastern portion of the historical region of
            Bengal, the area once formed, along with what is now the Indian state of West Bengal, the province of Bengal
            in British India. With the partition of India in 1947, it became the Pakistani province of East Bengal
            (later renamed East Pakistan), one of five provinces of Pakistan, separated from the other four by 1,100
            miles (1,800 km) of Indian territory. In 1971 it became the independent country of Bangladesh, with its
            capital at Dhaka.</p>

        <h1>The destroyer covid-19</h1>
        <p>With almost every country adopting aggressive non-therapeutic measures to control the spread of nCoV-2,
            Bangladesh in Southeastern Asia has followed the same trend; however, there is an ongoing debate as to
            whether measures have been adopted adequately and implemented efficiently. The country confirmed the first
            COVID-19 case in its territory on March 7, though many experts speculated that nCoV-2 may have entered the
            country earlier than that but had not been detected due to inadequate monitoring (4). As of April 13, the
            country had reported 803 cases of COVID-19, and the death toll stood at 39 (Figure 1) (5–7). However,
            concerns have been raised that extreme insufficiency of testing assays may be leaving many cases undetected
            in the country. In response to the emergence of the virus, Bangladesh admittedly reduced international
            flights, imposed thermal scanner checking, and shut down schools; however, offices maintained their regular
            schedules until March 26.</p>
